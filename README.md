# Hi, I'm Meysam 👋

SRE engineer turned indie hacker. Building SaaS in public and sharing everything I learn.

## 🚀 Current Focus

- **FindForce**: Business email finder with 95% accuracy
- **Customer Discovery**: Finding problems worth solving through real conversations
- **Building in Public**: Weekly lessons at [meysam.io](https://meysam.io)

## 💡 What I'm Learning

Failed my first SaaS (0 customers, 0 revenue). Now documenting the journey from DevOps engineer to technical founder.

**Key Lessons:**

- Distribution > Product (no one cares about your beautiful code if they don't know it exists)
- Talk to customers BEFORE building (the hard way is expensive)
- Speed matters more than perfection
- Revenue is the only metric that matters

## 🛠️ Technical Background

8+ years DevOps/SRE:

- Production systems at scale
- Kubernetes, CI/CD, infrastructure automation
- Building internal tools that ship
- Writing about it at [developer-friendly.blog](https://developer-friendly.blog)
