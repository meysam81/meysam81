# Introduce yourself in one paragraph

I've been working as a software engineer 🧑‍💻, and to give the last picture first 🌄,
I can imagine myself doing the exact same thing I'm doing today when I'm seventy:
software engineering 😍 (that is in fact if I'm alive by then). I have a huge
passion for growth and learning and as long as I'm learning, there's a meaning in
my life 🧗‍♀️. As a perfectionist, I either don't start anything, or I give my best
possible self to the task at hand; because mediocrity doesn't satisfy me. I'm
also a huge fan of body-building so when I'm not [writing](https://meysam81.com) ✍️,
or [coding](https://github.com/meysam81) 🤓, I'm in the gym lifting heavy weights 💪;
spoiler alert, I want to grow a six-pack.
