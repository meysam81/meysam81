# What's With the Purist Anti-AI Hate? A Defense of AI-Assisted Development

## My AI-First Approach to Building

over the course of the last few weeks and months, I've extensively used AI in
my day-to-day life.

for quite about everything.

coding, writing, brainstorming, prioritizing tasks, you name it.

and I regret not a single one of those momemts.

## The Anti-AI Backlash I'm Facing

yet somehow for some reason, there are these purist anti-AI folks out there
that vehemently oppose the use of AI in any form or shape.

I put my side projects in a relevant subreddit, and these individuals come out
in anger and hate, starting to villanize me for incorporating AI and letting
it run my projects.

### The Expectations vs Reality

I mean, what gives? you expect people to write codes in vim/emacs editor character
by character to sweat it out and really earn the recognition?

I don't get it. what year are you living in?

## Why Speed Matters for Side Projects

I'm not gonna spend 6 months building my side projects for your to be pleased
that I've done it the "right" way, only to realize that there's no demand for
the idea.

Similar to [my experience with FindForce](/blog/no-competition-red-flag-solopreneur-validated-market),
I learned that building perfect products without validation is pointless.

with the help of AI and speed of development, I get to work on it for 2-3 weeks,
and then move on to the next project. because it's fun to build stuff and I
don't have to write every function by hand to feel good about myself!

### The Real Motivation Behind Anti-AI Sentiment

that's probably for your own ego boost, thinking that you're still valuable
in this economy and in this era, by writing codes with your fingertips without
any help from AI.

good for you. I'm happy for you.

## To Each Their Own

but if you don't like AI-assisted coding, just don't use it. or go build your own,
or star someone else's repo. healthy competition is always welcome.

### How I Use AI for My Entire Workflow

I constantly create side projects, and even for marketing and distribution, I
get help from AI to build up a concrete and actionable roadmap on where to
submit and what tone to use.

I even ask it to give me tips for writing in the target audience's language style.

I've previously written about
[how AI-assisted coding killed my joy of programming](/blog/ai-assisted-coding-killed-programming-joy),
but that doesn't mean I don't use AI anymore. I do, and I'm not gonna apologize
to no motherfucker.

## My Philosophy on Technology

there's nothing wrong with AI-assisted coding, or even full-on vibecoding.

if you create something useful, and if people want it, then you've done the job!


and those who do not approve because they believe they are better than the rest
of us who sold our souls to AI and become tainted, I say this:

> to each their own.
