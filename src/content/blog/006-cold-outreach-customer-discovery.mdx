# I spent that last 2-3 weeks sending 200-300 cold outreach

I'm working on a new idea these days.

I've identified my niche...

researched the market...

analyzed the trends...

I've gathered some initial intel and aggregated some insights to help me navigate the next few steps.

they are essentially just a starter for me.. nothing fancy.

since I know from experience that _the things that you can't sell, are the things not worth building_, I'm not writing code yet
unless I know someone is taking out their credit card and paying for it with real money.

that means that I am strongly bullish on customer discovery these days.

I've sent out around a few hundreds so far

the conversions are low, to say the least..

but I'm locked in

I'm no quitter. **my mamma didn't raise no quitter**.

we're just getting started.

anyway, there's no crazy progress to share, only that I've been doing these cold outreach via LinkedIn and the response
rate is abysmal.

and so far, zero people got on a call.

the day I get to talk to 5-10 people is what I'd call Christmas.

## Lessons learned so far

I've been building in public for the past 2-3 weeks, much more seriously than I've done so before.

I shared my progress, my screenshots, my numbers and metrics publicly...

and the lesson is that consistency is key.

prior to this, I didn't get lots of impression nor engagement.

but lately I'm seeing a few likes here and there, maybe 1 comment the lady luck is with me that day

nothing to celebrate like a La Liga championship, but it is still progress

and believe me, for a perfectionist, progress is hard to come by.

## 2nd Public Piano Performance

last week I had my second public performance as a student learning to play piano.

the result of that performance is available at the following YouTube link: https://youtube.com/shorts/jgPCoNX3iGI

I am not going to include an embed because Google will slow down the page loading speed significantly, not to mention
the massive tracking and privacy concerns it raises.

it's like a leach on your website, sucking the life out of it, ruining the user experience and making your visitors miserable.

this is another example of showing up consistently. small wins add up, whether in cold outreach, building in public, or learning an instrument.

## Launching soon

https://awesome-directories.com is fully live.. two weeks so far...

we're live on Product Hunt this Friday: https://www.producthunt.com/products/awesome-directories

I would appreciate if you could take the time to check it out and leave a comment or an upvote

especially comments since those are a more serious signal of engagement than upvotes

## What's next

- I have a few ideas in mind
- some pre-baked products that need final touches
- more customer discovery to do
- learning my craft

and most important of all, the thing that keeps me up at night is this:

for every Monday, I map out a plan for my upcoming seven days, in a way that I have something to share as a key takeaway and/or
lesson in the next week when sharing my build in public journey.

this piece you're reading right now is a part of that plan.

I hope to continue sharing vulnerable struggles and even losses.

for example, this week and with hundreds of outreach and zero customer calls is a loss.

onwards and upwards because there's only one way to go from here: forward.
