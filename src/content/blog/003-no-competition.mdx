# No Competition? That's Usually a Red Flag for Solopreneurs (I Learned the Hard Way)

**I spent two months building FindForce. Perfect architecture. Clean code. Zero customers. Zero revenue.**

The moment that broke me wasn't the empty dashboard. It wasn't the crickets after launch. It was staring at my payment provider page showing **$0.00** in revenue—the only metric that actually mattered.

All that beautiful infrastructure? All those nights and weekends? All that SRE expertise I'd spent 8 years cultivating?

Meant nothing.

Because nobody was paying.

## The "No Competition" Trap I Fell Into

I built FindForce as a business email finder Chrome extension. Simple premise: help sales teams find and verify emails with 95% accuracy.

When I started researching the market, I found giants: Hunter, Apollo, dozens of others. My first reaction? **Fear**.

"How can I compete with them? They have teams. They have funding. They have thousands of customers."

So I looked for an angle. A gap. Something _they weren't doing_.

I found one: flat-rate pricing. Exceptional customer support. Speed.

Here's what I missed: **Those competitors weren't obstacles. They were validation.**

Thousands of companies were already **paying** for email finding tools. The demand was proven. The problem was real. People had budget allocated.

My job wasn't to invent a new category. My job was to do it better for a specific segment.

But I was too busy being proud of my "unique approach" to see it.

## How My SRE Background Betrayed Me

I spent 8 years as a SRE engineer. I built internal tools for dev teams. Kubernetes clusters. CI/CD pipelines. Infrastructure automation.

Here's the thing about internal tools: if you build them well, people use them. There's clear communication. Defined requirements. Immediate feedback.

**I had the wrong mental model.**

I thought: _"If I build it excellently, they will come."_

That works when your customers are coworkers in the next room. It doesn't work when your customers are strangers on the internet who've never heard of you.

I was **two layers removed** from real end users:

- Internal tools serve dev teams
- Dev teams serve external customers
- I never had to think about external customers

So I optimized for 10,000 users before I had 10. I built for scale before I had demand. I perfected the infrastructure before I validated the problem.

Classic engineer mistake.

## The Reddit Post That Changed Everything

Last week, frustrated and processing the FindForce failure, I wrote a post on X:

_"Unpopular opinion: if nobody's doing your startup idea, that's usually a red flag, not an opportunity."_

Got some traction. Felt bold. Tried it on Reddit.

**160+ upvotes. 60+ comments. 48,000+ views.**

The most viral moment of my 30 years on this planet.

Here's what I argued:

**No competition often means:**

- No demand exists
- Customer acquisition costs are too high
- Market education burden is too heavy for small teams
- Regulatory barriers make it unviable

**The sweet spot isn't an empty market. It's a crowded market with broken execution.**

The responses were fascinating. Some agreed violently. Others called me out on exceptions: Airbnb, Uber, blue ocean strategies.

They were both right.

## The Nuance Nobody Talks About (Solopreneur Reality)

Here's what I should have said in that Reddit post:

**For VC-backed teams with deep pockets, blue ocean strategies can work.**

You can afford:

- A GTM team to educate the market
- Designers and engineers to iterate quickly
- Geographic advantages (SF networking, warm intros)
- Multiple attempts before running out of runway

**For solopreneurs, immigrants, new parents with limited time and zero network? Different game entirely.**

I'm all three. Iranian immigrant. New father. Building from home. No alumni network. No conference circuit. No warm intros.

I have to do **cold DM and cold email outreach** for every. single. customer conversation.

Last week I sent **40 cold LinkedIn messages** to my ICP. Got **9 responses**. Booked **1 customer discovery call**.

That's the reality. Not 100 interviews. Not warm intros through YC. Not a network from Stanford or MIT.

Just me, a spreadsheet, and a lot of rejection.

## When "No Competition" Might Actually Work

I'm not saying blue ocean strategies never work for solopreneurs. But you need specific conditions:

### ✅ You MIGHT pursue a no-competition idea if:

**1. You have deep domain expertise**

- You're not flying blind
- You understand the problem intimately
- You've lived it for years

**2. You've done 10+ customer interviews**

- They're actively complaining about the pain
- They're already trying to solve it (badly)
- They have budget allocated

**3. The market shift just happened**

- New regulation created the need
- New technology made it possible
- Timing is everything

**4. You have an existing audience**

- You're not starting from zero
- You have distribution built-in
- Think: YouTuber launching a SaaS

**5. It's a niche too small for VCs, too big to ignore**

- Not venture-scale
- But sustainable for one person
- Examples: specific industry tools

### ❌ Don't pursue no-competition ideas if:

- You're learning the industry as you build
- You have no audience or network
- You need quick revenue to survive
- The market education would take years
- You're a solo technical founder with zero sales experience (hi, that was me)

## What I'm Doing Differently Now (Build in Public)

I'm done building in a vacuum. Here's my new playbook:

### 1. Distribution First, Product Second

I just launched [awesome-directories.com](https://awesome-directories.com) — a curated directory aggregator for indie hackers. **300+ directories, open source, Apache-2 license, completely free.**

This is the **opposite** of FindForce:

- FindForce: Built product → tried to find users
- awesome-directories: Build for community → recognition → audience → monetize later (maybe even not!)

Why? Because **people listen to you when you give first.**

I'm not charging. No paywall. No "freemium" trap. Just pure value.

If people subscribe to my newsletter or buy me a coffee, great. If not, I'm still building trust and recognition.

### 2. Ruthless Customer Discovery

Before I write a single line of code for my next SaaS, I'm doing:

- **200 cold LinkedIn DMs** (sent 40 last week)
- Aiming for **6+ booked customer discovery calls**
- Asking about their **last painful experience** with the problem
- Checking if they're **already paying for a solution**
- Understanding **why** they're not satisfied

I'm doing **A/B testing on my outreach messages**. Data-driven iteration. Engineer's approach to sales.

Does it hurt when 31 out of 40 people ignore me? Yes.

Do I keep going? Also yes.

**Resilience and persistence are founder prerequisites.**

### 3. Value-First, Always

Every piece of content. Every tool. Every interaction.

Give, give, give. Ask little.

That's how you build an audience as an unknown immigrant founder with no network.

## The Framework: Should You Pursue Your "No Competition" Idea?

Here's my decision tree for solopreneurs:

### Step 1: Count the Competitors

- **0-1 competitors:** 🚩 High risk. Proceed with extreme caution.
- **2-10 competitors:** ✅ Good. Demand is validated.
- **10+ competitors:** ⚠️ Can you differentiate? Do you have unfair advantage?

### Step 2: Talk to Customers FIRST

- **Before writing code:** 10+ customer interviews minimum
- Ask: "Tell me about the last time you had this problem"
- Ask: "What are you currently using to solve it?"
- Ask: "What do you hate about current solutions?"
- **Red flag:** If they're not actively searching for solutions, problem isn't big enough

### Step 3: Check Your Resources

- **Time:** Can you afford 6-12 months of market education?
- **Money:** Can you survive without revenue during that period?
- **Network:** Can you reach your ICP without paid ads?
- **Expertise:** Do you understand this domain deeply?

**If you answered "no" to 2+ questions, choose a validated market.**

### Step 4: Look for These Green Flags

- ✅ Competitors exist but execution is broken
- ✅ Customers complaining publicly about current solutions
- ✅ You have an unfair advantage (expertise, audience, speed)
- ✅ Clear, specific niche you can dominate
- ✅ People are actively searching for solutions (Google/Reddit evidence)

### Step 5: Make the Call

- **Blue ocean:** Only if you have resources, network, or deep expertise
- **Validated market:** Default choice for bootstrapped solopreneurs
- **Crowded market:** Your best bet—demand is proven, execution is improvable

## The Honest Truth: I'm Still Figuring This Out

I haven't cracked the code. I'm not writing this from a yacht.

I'm writing this from my home office, with a 4-month-old son in the next room, trying to build something that matters while doing cold outreach to strangers.

**But here's what I know for sure:**

1. **Competition validates demand.** I was scared of Hunter and Apollo. I should have been grateful they existed.

2. **Technical excellence means nothing without customers.** My clean code didn't matter. My 95% accuracy didn't matter. Nothing mattered until someone paid.

3. **Distribution > Product.** Always. The best product that nobody knows about is worthless.

4. **Solopreneurs can't afford to educate markets.** Leave blue oceans to funded teams. You need validated demand.

5. **Give first, ask later.** Build trust through value. awesome-directories is my bet on this strategy.

## What Happens Next

I'm continuing the 200 cold DM experiment. I'll share the results—success or failure.

I'm building awesome-directories in public, documenting everything.

I'm doing customer discovery the right way this time. Every conversation. Every pattern. Every insight.

And I'm accepting that **progress beats perfection** every single time.

Will it work? I don't know.

But I'm showing up. I'm pushing through. I'm learning.

**That's the only way forward.**

## Key Takeaways for Solopreneurs

If you only remember three things from this post:

**1. Competition = Validation**
If nobody's doing it, ask "why" before assuming you found a gap. Most gaps exist because there's no demand or prohibitive barriers.

**2. Talk to Customers Before Building**
10+ interviews minimum. Ask about their past behavior, not hypothetical future. "Would you use this?" is a worthless question.

**3. Distribution First**
Build audience through free value (tools, content, templates). Trust compounds. Then sell to people who already know and like you.
